# Filtering function f√ºr Rico:

filtering = function(x,y){ # x = id column vector; y = full data set (i.e., given class = data frame)
  library(dplyr) # load dplyr
  inter = duplicated(x)*1  # duplicated gives a logical, multiplied by 1
                           # and transforms it into a binary vector         
  binded = as.data.frame(cbind(inter,x)) # bind id column and binary vector (column)
                                         # + change class to data frame,
                                         # otherwise upcoming dplyr filter 
                                         # function wont work:   
  
  inter2=filter(binded, inter == "1" )   # filter rows with binary 0 :=
                                         # explicit non (!) duplicate values
  
  blank = matrix(0,length(x))            # matrix vector list for the nested for loop:
  
  for(i in 1:length(inter2$x)){          # for each individual[i] value of inter2
                                         # i.e., each value with duplicates
     for(j in 1:length(x)){              # + for each respective duplicate
                                         #  value in column vector with the ids,
       if(x[j] == inter2$x[i]){          # if i_dth value is equivalent to 
                                         # the evaluated explicit duplicate id values
          blank[j] = 1  # then / in such a case assing a 1 to the redundant binary/logical column
       }
     }
   }
  
  data_frame = cbind(y,blank)   # Now combinde the redundant binary column 
                                # with the whole data frame that carries 
                                # the id column
  data_frame = as.data.frame(data_frame) # turn it into a data frame
  filtered=filter(data_frame, blank != "1" ) # ... in order to finally filter 
                                         # all (!) redundant id values, no 
                                         # matter how many duplicates there are,
    #  in other words: if any id value had a duplicate, both the original 
    #  and duplicate were erased, due to the fact that column and row wise
    #  relation cannot be evaluated unambivalently in the given data set by Rico Schmitt. 
  return(filtered) # return filtered returns the values of the respective object, 
                   # i.e., the filtered full data frame
